## make a plot
ggplot(data = siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm, color = site))+
  geom_line()
## save the las plot
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-line.png"))
## another possible plot

ggplot(siteyear_summary, aes(x = year, y = median_size_mm)) +

## saving plot columns

There are `r nrow(lobsters)` total lobsters included in this report 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
